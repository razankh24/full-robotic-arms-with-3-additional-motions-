task: robotic arms 


two arms consist of 6 servo motors (3 at each side)

with 3 coded moves ( disclaimer: I did not test these motions in real life I calculated it with the best logic I had) 

- I included the initial point.
- base servos (4,1) move from 0 to 90. 
- the elbow servos (2,5) move from 90 to 135 (135-90=45) which indicates that here they will rise 45 above the level that base servos reached. 
- no need to move the balm servos(3,6)  

first move: waving with one hand

- servo3 (this servo is located at the very end of the robot right arm) has to move back and forth in 90 degrees to mimic a waving hand.
this move can be coded when the robot says their greeting to people, also it can be improved further and wave both hands or the other hand instead.  

second move: sadness where both hands fall beside the robot

- both base and elbow servos will reduce their angles to 0. 

third move: hooray! (raising both hands in victory or pure joy) 

- this move is tricky to imagine because it can be a little rough in real life, but I pretend the hooray! the move will come from the sadness one 

and base servos will rise again from 0 to 180, of course, we can add motion to the elbow servos but until we try it in real life, but now I

added only basic moves for the sake of simplicity.
